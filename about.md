Hello World

It’s Sharad!, I love making projects, having fun and enjoy playing video games.

My most impressive skills include clicking, right clicking and double clicking, in my free time you will find me either working on some cool project or drinking **Cold Coffee**.

I'm currently developing a visual interface for the Ciphers in Cryptography

Contact me anytime for the Opportunities, Open Source project ideas or in case you need help :D
