If you're troubleshooting Side-by-Side (SxS) errors on Windows, the SxsTrace tool can be really helpful. Hereâ€™s how you can quickly generate and parse a trace log:

**Step 1: Generate the Trace Log**

```sh
SxsTrace Trace -logfile:SxsTrace.etl
```
This command starts the trace and saves the output to `SxsTrace.etl`.


**Step 2: Repeat any step at OS level like launching an app that crashes.**

**Step 3: Parse the Trace Log**

```sh
SxsTrace Parse -logfile:SxsTrace.etl -outfile:SxsTrace.txt
```

This converts the `.etl` trace into a readable `.txt` file. Open `SxsTrace.txt` to review detailed information about the SxS error and troubleshoot accordingly.

That's it! Using SxsTrace makes diagnosing SxS issues much easier.
