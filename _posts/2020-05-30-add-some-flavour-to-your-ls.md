Most of us use `ls` just the way it is provided by default but today we are going to add some flavour to the boring `ls` using `exa`, as they say `exa` is a modern version of `ls`.

But wait a minute before we begin the setup let's see what is the difference between the ls before it and afterwards.

**Before exa**

**After exa**

**So Let's begin !!!**

## STEP-1: Installing exa using cargo

If you don't have cargo already installed you need to install it first and then proceed further.

Ubuntu users can install it via apt

```bash
sudo apt-get install cargo
```

For other distros visit [this link](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), it will take just few minutes.

Now that you have cargo installed run the following command

```bash
cargo install exa
```

it will take around 4-5 minute because of the build process of `exa`

## STEP-2: Adding exa to the PATH

Open your terminal's rc file and just add the following to it

```bash
# PATH
export PATH=$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH

# Alias
alias ls="exa -al --color=always --group-directories-first"
```

### That's it

you have successfully configured your terminal with the fancy ls :)
